How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
 efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can know the differences i have made and change that if some problem occurs
 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros -
    1. Can save from not usefull commits
    2. Can reduce cluster fuck of so many commits
    Cons -
    1. We acn forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is good to save all files in one commit so we can track each file with commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    using git log we can view different commits made and with git diff we can campare
    two different commits and see their changes made

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can know where i messed up. So i can go back and make that right.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to know my previous projects that are setup on git and read them that 
    what have i done there.
